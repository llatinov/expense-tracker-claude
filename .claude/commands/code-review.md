# Code Review Command

Carefully perform a comprehensive code review of $ARGUMENTS.

## Review Standards
Examples of excellent code that you should match the design/style/conventions of:
- `src/components/Expenses/ExpenseList.tsx` (React components)
- `src/contexts/ExpenseCOntext.tsx` (custom context)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` (utility functions)

## Process
1. **First**: Read the example files above to understand our design patterns, naming conventions, and code style
2. **Second**: Analyze $ARGUMENTS against these standards
3. **Third**: Create detailed critique covering:
   - Code structure and organization
   - Adherence to established patterns
   - Performance considerations
   - Security implications
   - Maintainability concerns
   - Test coverage gaps

## Output Requirements
- Save review as `ai-code-reviews/{filename}.review.md` for each file reviewed
- Include specific line references for issues
- Provide concrete suggestions for improvements
- Rate overall quality: Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor
- Estimate refactoring effort: Low/Medium/High

## Review Checklist
- Follows project naming conventions
