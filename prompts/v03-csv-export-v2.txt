Excellent work on Version 1! Now I want you to implement the SAME data export feature in a completely different way.

VERSION CONTROL:
- Switch back to "main" branch
- Create a new branch called "feature-data-export-v2"
- This should be a completely fresh implementation

VERSION 2 REQUIREMENTS:
Implement an ADVANCED export system with these features:
- Export modal/dialog with multiple options
- Multiple export formats: CSV, JSON, and PDF
- Date range filtering for exports (start date, end date)
- Category filtering for exports (select specific categories)
- Preview of data before export (show table of what will be exported)
- Custom filename input field
- Export summary showing how many records will be exported
- Loading states during export process

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
This version should feel like a professional business application export feature. Think about what a power user would want - lots of control and options. Use a modal or drawer interface, not just a simple button.

Make this implementation completely different from Version 1:
- Different UI components and patterns
- Different user experience flow
- More sophisticated code architecture
- Professional polish and attention to detail

PROCESS:
1. Switch back to original branch
2. Create and checkout: git checkout -b feature-data-export-v2
3. Implement the advanced export system
4. Test all the functionality thoroughly
5. Commit your changes

Show me what's possible with a more sophisticated approach. Be creative!
