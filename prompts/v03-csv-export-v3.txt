Great work on Version 2! Now let's try a third completely different approach to the same export feature.

VERSION CONTROL:
- Switch back to "main" branch
- Create branch "feature-data-export-v3"

VERSION 3 REQUIREMENTS:
Implement a CLOUD-INTEGRATED export system with these features:
- Email export functionality (simulated - show UI flow)
- Google Sheets integration mockup (show what the flow would look like)
- Automatic backup scheduling options (UI for setting up recurring exports)
- Export history tracking (show previous exports with timestamps)
- Sharing capabilities - generate shareable links or QR codes
- Export templates (different formats for different purposes: "Tax Report", "Monthly Summary", "Category Analysis")
- Integration mockups with popular tools (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
- Cloud storage options and sync status indicators

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
Think like a modern SaaS application - focus on connectivity, sharing, and integration with other services. Even if we're simulating some integrations, make the UI and user flow feel like a real cloud service.

This should feel completely different from both Version 1 (simple) and Version 2 (advanced local):
- Modern cloud service aesthetic
- Focus on sharing and collaboration
- Integration-first mindset
- Background processing concepts
- Service connectivity themes

Be creative and surprise me with innovative features around data export, sharing, and cloud integration that I might not have thought of!

PROCESS:
1. Switch to the original branch
2. Create and checkout: git checkout -b feature-data-export-v3
3. Implement the cloud-integrated export system
4. Make it feel modern, connected, and innovative
5. Commit your changes

Think big picture - how would a company like Notion or Airtable approach this feature?
