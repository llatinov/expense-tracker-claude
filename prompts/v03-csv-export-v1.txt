I want to add data export functionality to my expense tracker. For this first version, implement a SIMPLE approach.

VERSION CONTROL:
- Before you start, create a new branch called "feature-data-export-v1"
- Make all your changes in this branch
- Commit your changes when complete

VERSION 1 REQUIREMENTS:
- Add an "Export Data" button to the main dashboard
- When clicked, export all expenses as a CSV file
- Include columns: Date, Category, Amount, Description
- Use a simple, straightforward implementation
- Keep the UI minimal - just a button that triggers the download

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
Focus on simplicity and getting it working quickly. Don't overthink the user experience - just make it functional. Use standard browser APIs for file download.

PROCESS:
1. Create and checkout the new branch "feature-data-export-v1"
2. Implement the CSV export functionality
3. Add the export button to the dashboard
4. Test that it works correctly
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message

Remember: This is Version 1 of 3 - keep it simple and functional.
